Polytopes and Linear Programming
In this chapter, we review many of the main ideas and results concerning polytopes and linear programming. These ideas and results are prerequisite to much
of combinatorial optimization.
0.1 Finite Systems of Linear Inequalities
Let x k, k ∈ N, be a finite set of points in Rn. Any point x ∈ Rn of the form
x = k∈N λkx k, with λk ∈ R, is a linear combination of the x k. If, in addition,
we have all λk ≥ 0, then the combination is conical. If k∈N λk = 1, then
the combination is affine. Combinations that are both conical and affine are
convex. The points x k ∈ Rn, k ∈ N, are linearly independent if k∈N λkx k = 0
implies λk = 0 ∀ k ∈ N. The points x k ∈ Rn, k ∈ N, are affinely independent if
k∈N λkx k = 0,k∈N λk = 0 implies λk = 0∀k ∈ N.Equivalently, the points
x k ∈ Rn, k ∈ N, are affinely independent if the points x1k ∈ Rn+1, k ∈ N, are
linearly independent.
A set X ⊂ Rn is a subspace/cone/affine set/convex set if it is closed under (finite) linear/conical/affine/convex combinations. The linear span/conical
hull/affine span/convex hull of X, denoted sp(X)/cone(X)/aff(X)/conv(X), is
the set of all (finite) linear/conical/affine/convex combinations of points in X.
Equivalently, and this needs a proof, sp(X)/cone(X)/aff(X)/conv(X) is the
intersection of all subspaces/cones/affine sets/convex sets containing X.
